This system provides a user-friendly interface where administrators can input teacher and 
tutor details with ease. Whether it's adding a new lecturer to the faculty or updating the 
salary of a tutor based on their performance, our program simplifies these tasks.
The Teacher and Tutor Management System is built upon the Java programming 
language, a versatile and widely used language known for its robustness and crossplatform compatibility. Leveraging the Swing framework, a part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC), allowed for the creation of a user-friendly graphical interface, enabling 
administrators to interact seamlessly with the system

BlueJ was used while making this project so. This is a BlueJproject file. But Just simply run the TeacherGUI.java class in any IDE to see how the program functions.
